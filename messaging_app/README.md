#Djangorest Framework Project
Overview
In this project, learners will explore the complete lifecycle of designing and implementing robust RESTful APIs using Django. They will begin with scaffolding the project environment and progressively move through identifying and defining data models, establishing database relationships, and setting up clean, scalable URL routing. Emphasis is placed on following Django’s best practices to ensure maintainable and production-ready codebases.

This project serves as a foundation for any backend developer aiming to master API development using the Django framework and prepares learners to build secure, scalable systems that follow modern architectural patterns.

Project Objectives
By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

Scaffold a Django project using industry-standard project structures.
Identify, define, and implement scalable data models using Django’s ORM.
Establish one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between models.
Create clean and modular Django apps.
Set up and configure URL routing for APIs using Django’s path and include functions.
Follow best practices in file structure, code organization, and documentation.
Build a maintainable API layer using Django REST Framework (optional enhancement).
Validate and test APIs with real data using tools like Postman or Swagger.
